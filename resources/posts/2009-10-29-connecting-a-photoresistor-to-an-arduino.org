#+title: Connecting a Photoresistor to an Arduino
#+tags: arduino

A photoresistor is a resistor whose resistance decreases with increasing
incident light intensity, using a photoresistor we can make arduino
sense the intensity of light around it.

Using the [[http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Learning/PhotoResistor][playground]] article as reference, resistor (100K) and
photoresistor are connected in series. +5V goes to resistor, ground
goes to photoresistor, the junction where the resistor and
photoresistor meets goes to analog 0. Digital 13 is used for the LED.

In my room photoresistor reads around 80, when I put my thumb on it
making it dark, it reads around 500. I wanted the LED to light up when
its dark.

#+begin_src c++
  int lightPin = 0;  //define a pin for Photo resistor
  int threshold = 250;
  
  void setup(){
      Serial.begin(9600);  //Begin serial communcation
      pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
  
  }
  
  void loop(){
      Serial.println(analogRead(lightPin)); 
      
      if(analogRead(lightPin) > threshold ){    
          digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
          Serial.println("high"); 
      }else{
          digitalWrite(13, LOW);
          Serial.println("low"); 
      }
      
      delay(100);
  }

So I picked a number in between and used it as threshold, if the reading
is above the threshold it turns the LED on when its below threshold it
turns the LED off.

#+title: Cloning Pong Part 1
#+tags: clojure arduino pong

This will be a two part write up, part one will cover building a
simple [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong][pong]] game in Clojure, part two will cover, interfacing it with
[[http://www.arduino.cc/][Arduino]], so that we can control the game using knobs like the
original.

I wanted to keep the code simple so it has some flaws such as the ball
only goes in 45 degree angles and you can only hit the ball with the
front of the pad. If you want a perfect clone, flaws can be fixed at
the expense of making the code a little bit more complex.

Two references are used in the game, one for the ball and one for the
players,

#+begin_example
  {:x 400, :y 200, :size 8, :dir {:x -1, :y 1}}
#+end_example

Reference for the ball contains it's x and y coordinates on the game
board and the direction it is travelling.

#+begin_example
  {:1 {:x 10 :y 200 :src 0} 
   :2 {:x 400 :y 300 :src 0}}
#+end_example

Reference for the players contains positions of the pads and keeps track
of the scores. Thats all the mutable state the game has.

#+begin_src clojure
  (ns pong
    (:import (javax.swing JFrame JPanel Timer)
             (java.awt Color BasicStroke Font Toolkit)
             (java.awt.event KeyListener KeyEvent ActionListener)))
  
  (def board-size {:w 800 :h 400})
  (def pad-size {:w 5 :h 25})
  (def step {:right 5 :left -5 :up 5 :down -5})
  
  (defn beep []
    (.beep (. Toolkit getDefaultToolkit)))
  
  (defn move-player [p dir player]
    (let [x (if (= p :1) (:x (:1 @player)) (:x (:2 @player)))
          y (if (= p :1) (:y (:1 @player)) (:y (:2 @player)))
          delta (* 3 (if (= dir :up) (:up step) (:down step)))]
      (dosync (alter player merge 
                     {p {:x x :y (- y delta) :src (:src (p @player))}}))))
#+end_src

#+begin_example
  (move-player :1 :up 
               (ref {:1 {:x 10 :y 200 :src 0} :2 {:x 400 :y 300 :src 0}}))
  pong=> {:1 {:x 10, :y 185, :src 0}, :2 {:x 400, :y 300, :src 0}}
#+end_example

When move-player is called, depending on the player and direction value
passed, it will calculate the new x and y coordinates and update the
player reference.

#+begin_src clojure
  (defn place-ball []
    (let [x (if (= (rand-int 2) 0) -1 1)
          y (if (= (rand-int 2) 0) -1 1)]
      {:x (int (/ (:w board-size) 2)) 
       :y (int (/ (:h board-size) 2)) :size 8 :dir {:x x :y y}}))
#+end_src

Every time a player scores, position of the ball is reset, it will be
placed in the middle of the board with a random direction.

#+begin_src clojure
  (defn move-ball [ball]
    (let [x (cond (= 1  (:x (:dir @ball))) (+ (:x @ball) (:right step))
                  (= -1 (:x (:dir @ball))) (+ (:x @ball) (:left step))
                  :else (:x @ball))
          y (cond (= 1  (:y (:dir @ball))) (+ (:y @ball) (:up step))
                  (= -1 (:y (:dir @ball))) (+ (:y @ball) (:down step))
                  :else (:y @ball))]
      (dosync (alter ball merge {:x x :y y}))))
#+end_src

Before every repaint of the game board, we move the ball in the
direction it is going and update its reference.

#+begin_src clojure
  (defn inc-score [p player]
    (beep)
    (dosync (alter player merge {p {:x (:x (p @player)) :y (:y (p @player))
                                    :src (inc (:src (p @player)))}})))
  
  (defn wall-collision [ball player]
    (cond
     (<= (:x @ball) 0) (do (inc-score :1 player)
                           (dosync (ref-set ball (place-ball))))
     (>= (:x @ball) (:w board-size)) (do (inc-score :2 player)
                                         (dosync (ref-set ball (place-ball))))
     :else
     (let [dir-x (:x (:dir @ball))
           dir-y (cond (<= (:y @ball) 0) 1
                       (>= (:y @ball) (:h board-size)) -1
                       :else (:y (:dir @ball)))]
       (dosync (alter ball merge {:dir {:x dir-x :y dir-y}})))))
#+end_src

Here we check for collisions, if the ball hits the right wall, we
increment player one's score and reset the ball, if the ball hits the
left wall we increment player two's score and reset the ball, if the
ball hits the upper or the lower wall, we change it's y direction which
will cause it to bounce from the wall.

#+begin_src clojure
  (defn player-collision [ball player]
    ;;p1 collision
    (if (and (=  (:x @ball) (+ (:x (:1 @player)) (:w pad-size)))
             (>= (:y @ball) (:y (:1 @player)))
             (<= (:y @ball) (+ (:y (:1 @player)) (:h pad-size))))
      (do (dosync (alter ball merge {:dir {:x 1 :y (:y (:dir @ball))}}))
          (beep)))
    ;;p2 collision
    (if (and (=  (:x @ball) (:x (:2 @player)))
             (>= (:y @ball) (:y (:2 @player)))
             (<= (:y @ball) (+ (:y (:2 @player)) (:h pad-size)))) 
      (do (dosync (alter ball merge {:dir {:x -1 :y (:y (:dir @ball))}}))
          (beep))))
#+end_src

Besides walls, ball collides with the player pads, when the ball
collides, with a player we keep it's y direction but change it's x
direction to send it in the opposite direction.

#+begin_src clojure

#+end_src

paintComponent just draws the board nothing too fancy, actionPerformed
however contains the game logic, every 50 millisecond we move the ball,
check for a wall collision, check for a player collision then repaint the
game board. All that's needed now, is to put the game board in a frame and
start it's timer.

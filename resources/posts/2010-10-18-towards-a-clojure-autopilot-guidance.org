#+title: Towards a Clojure Autopilot - Guidance
#+tags: clojure flightgear

Now that we have covered the [[http://nakkaya.com/2010/10/07/towards-a-clojure-autopilot-first-steps/][basics]] , we can move on to the fun stuff,
getting from /A/ to /B/ by following a set of GPS coordinates. To
actually fly from one way point to another we need two sets of
controllers, the ones we defined earlier (roll and pitch hold) will
act as our bottom layer on top of that we are going to define another
set of controllers (altitude and heading hold) that will modify set
points for the bottom layer, i.e altitude hold controls pitch hold to
climb or decent to the desired altitude and heading hold controls roll
hold to turn the aircraft to the desired heading.

Even though a simple proportional controller worked for the previous
example it won't work for the real thing, the reason being that a
proportional controller only accounts for the current error so a
plane flying against the wind can't accelerate using a proportional
controller, it will eventually get stuck at a speed lower than the
desired speed. This is where [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller][PID controller]] comes into
play, PID stands for Proportional, Integral, Derivative. In a nutshell,
proportional term just like before calculates a correction value
depending on how far we are away from the desired set point, integral
term acts as memory it will respond to accumulated error over time, as
accumulated error over time grows integral term will grow which in turn
will make our correction grow so even if the wind pushes us back
integral term will compensate for it and apply more throttle over time
just like a human would, derivative term tries to predict the future by
calculating a response to the rate of change of the error basically it
makes the controller anticipate approaching the set point. 

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
  \begin{equation}
    correction = K_p \times error + K_d \times (error - prevError) + K_i \times (sumOfErrors)
  \end{equation}
#+END_EXPORT

PID formula won't change from application to application, what will
change however are those constants (K_p, K_d and K_i). i.e. the more you
decrease your K_i constant the less memory your controller will
have. Despite the simple looking formula there is an entire theory
behind PID so I would suggest googling it for more information on theory
and tuning.

First we make sure both set point and current value are within the input
range, then we map them to a range between -1/+1 so they are a
percentage between -100% and 100% of the scale, then we move on with our
calculation. The only part that needs special care is the integral part,
we need to take care of a problem called integral windup, again think
speed, going from 0 to 80 km/h is going to take a long time by the time
you reach 80 km/h your integral will be huge and it will make you
overshoot the target speed maybe accelerate to 100 km/h then decrease
and settle on 80 km/h thats why the integral is kept in range
-1/+1. Finally we sum all the terms and scale them to output range.

Moving on to controllers, we have 5 of them,

 - Speed Hold
 - Heading Hold -> Roll Hold
 - Altitude Hold -> Pitch Hold

They all share the same structure a hold function that calculates the
correction and a set! function for modifying the set point.

Altitude hold takes the current altitude and calculates a pitch angle
for the aircraft that is between -10 and 10 degrees then it changes the
set point of the pitch hold to that angle that causes the plane to
climb, hold or decent to that altitude.

For navigation, we need to know two things course and distance to target,
following two functions are from [[http://williams.best.vwh.net/avform.htm][Aviation Formulary]],

bearing returns the heading we need to take to reach c2 from c1,
distance returns the distance between points in kilometers.

Earth isn't flat so we can't calculate bearing once and be done with it,
bearing to way-point will change during the course of the flight so
every time guidance is called we calculate a new bearing to the
way-point, use it as the set point for the heading hold, heading hold
will in turn modify the set point for roll hold just like altitude
hold. Once we are within a kilometer of the way point we drop it and
move on to the next way-point.

Before we send a control packet back, we log our current position
that way after the flight we can take a look at the path taken in Google
Earth, then we let high level controllers calculate new set-points for
low level controllers and send calculated correction values from low
level controllers to FlightGear.

#+title: Pearson Correlation Score
#+tags: clojure programming-collective-intelligence

This post will cover another topic from [[http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596529321][Programming Collective
Intelligence]] that is used to define similarities between items called
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient][Pearson correlation score]], the formula for this algorithm looks like
the following,

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
  \begin{equation}
    r = \frac{\sum XY - \frac{\sum X \times \sum Y }{N}}
             {\sqrt{(\sum X^2- \frac{(\sum X)^2}{N}) - (\sum Y^2- \frac{(\sum Y)^2}{N})}}
  \end{equation}
#+END_EXPORT

This calculation returns a value between -1 and 1. Two users with a
similarity of 1 have rated every item identically. Unlike [[http://nakkaya.com/2009/11/11/euclidean-distance-score/][Euclidean Distance Score]]
this formula doesn't need to be normalized. Pearson correlation score,
also accounts for average ratings for each user, a user that rates
everything 5 and a user that rates everything 1 will have a similarity
of 1. This  may or may not be the behavior you want depending on your
situation.

Using the same critics map from [[http://nakkaya.com/2009/11/11/euclidean-distance-score/][Euclidean Distance Score]],

#+begin_example
  user=> (pearson (critics "Lisa Rose") (critics "Gene Seymour"))

  user=> (pearson (critics "Lisa Rose") {})

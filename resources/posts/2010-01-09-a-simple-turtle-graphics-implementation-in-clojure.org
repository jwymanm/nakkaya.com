#+title: A Simple Turtle Graphics Implementation in Clojure
#+tags: clojure graphics

Turtle graphics is a popular way of introducing programming to
kids. It was part of the original Logo programming language developed
by Wally Feurzig and Seymour Papert in 1966. Turtle, originally a
robotic creature moves on the floor. It takes commands relative to its
own position, such as "move forward 10 steps" and "turn left 90
degrees". Turtle also has a pen which may be lowered to the floor so
that a trace is left of where it has traveled.
